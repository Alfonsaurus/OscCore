# OscCore
A **performance-oriented** OSC library for Unity

### Why Another OSC Library ?

There are already at least 4 other OSC implementations for Unity:
- [OscJack](https://github.com/keijiro/OscJack), [ExtOSC](https://github.com/Iam1337/extOSC), [UnityOSC](https://github.com/jorgegarcia/UnityOSC), & [OscSimpl](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/osc-simpl-53710)

OscCore was created largely because all of these other libraries _allocate memory for each received message_, which will cause lots of garbage collections when used with a large amount of messages.

###### Because of Strings

Every OSC message starts with an "address", specified as an ascii string.  
It's perfectly reasonable to represent this address in C# as a standard `string`, which is how other libraries work.

However, because strings in C# are immutable & UTF16, every time we receive a message from the network, this now requires us to allocate a new `string` & expand the received ascii string's bytes to UTF16.   

OscCore eliminates both 
- string allocation
- the need to convert ascii bytes to UTF16

This works through leveraging the [BlobHandles](https://github.com/stella3d/BlobHandles) package.  
Incoming message's addresses are matched directly against their unmanaged ascii bytes.  

This has two benefits 
- no memory is allocated when a message is received
- takes less CPU time to parse a message

### Protocol Support

All [OSC 1.0 types](http://opensoundcontrol.org/spec-1_0), required and non-standard are supported.  
The spec is somewhat unclear about how array / list tags are supposed to work, however.
